  <h2>Dreamcatcher Bios Proposal</h2>
  
 <p>This was a multipage proposal I designed for a film and television company. This document was used to procure funding for a 30 minute long documentary television series. The document had to be designed in such a way that the reader could get a sense of what the series was about even if they werenâ€™t reading the full text. This was achieved through careful use of typographical hierarchy, deliberate choice of colours and thoughtful image placement.
