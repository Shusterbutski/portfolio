 <h2>Bain Reality</h2>
  
 <p>This site was developed while working with a digital marketing firm. It was to act as a demo site for the firm to show potential clients in the real estate industry. I designed and developed the site using bootstrap which allowed me to quickly produce a quality and fully responsive website.  A real estate listing plugin which was php based was used to power the listings.
