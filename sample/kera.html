  <h2>KeraSpa Website</h2>
   <p>This site was designed and developed by me from the ground up. It is a WordPress site but with plenty of customizations. The challenge was to present both the company and itâ€™s products in an engaging and interactive way. The end goal was to develop a site in which the user is curious to explore the whole site and get excited about the product lines.
