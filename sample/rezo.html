    <h2>Rezolution Pictures International</h2>
  <p>I came on board to redesign this website after the client was disappointed. I cleaned up the design as well as added functionality that was requested by the included such as an inclusion of a blog and newsfeed. In the end I was able to take something the client wasnâ€™t happy with and turn it into something they were proud show.
